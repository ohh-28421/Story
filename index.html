<center><h1>The Origin of Unblocked Premium</h1></center>
<p>I will be telling the origin of the website anyway enough stalling lets get to it. So in a class called US History i Saw a bunch of poeple use Unblocked Game Websites made in Google Sites and That gave Me an Idea.</p>
<p>I thought People Should be doing their Work or Somthing But to be fair i didnt do it either So the Idea came to my Head to Make a fake gamesite because i Was Board in class "Disclaimer Only people who don't do their work does this" So in class i made a website It did not have Games.</p>
<p>I made it because I was bored. When I finished the Google Site, I showed it to people, and yay, I was happy. Since I was pleased with my creation, I decided to update it daily on my school Chromebook. Here are the versions, from "dev to 2.0." Version 2.0 is my favorite, but the school deleted it, which you'll understand why later. But for now, let's get back to the story.</p>

<p>I showed the updated version to my US History teacher, and they liked version 2.0 better than the old one. Yeah!</p>

<p>Sometime in February 2024, I joined a group on Google Classroom that can’t be created again because it was started by my new friend, Oliver. He created it when he was new to the school, but then the school IT admin blocked his ability to create new classrooms. The classrooms he made were called "Sussy Baka" and "Sussy Baka 2."</p>

<p>Here’s how I got in. Before I knew about the classroom, I saw another kid bragging about "INTERSTELLAR," which unblocks any website. I went over to him, and he showed me that he had access to everything. He wouldn’t give me the link, but I copied it and visited the site myself. I was like, "Wow!" until it got blocked a few days later.</p>

<p>The kid told me Hunter had given it to him. So, when I realized the "INTERSTELLAR" was blocked, I asked Hunter for another unblocked link, but he was rude and said no. I thought maybe he didn’t have any links. I also asked if I could join "Sussy Baka," but he refused.</p>

<p>When I was in math class, I was talking to random people, and Oliver replied that INTERSTELLAR is a proxy. I went to lunch with him, and he invited me to the Google Classroom. I initially thought he didn’t run the classroom, but it turns out he did. I was thinking, "Man, Hunter is mean, but Oliver is a nice person."</p>

<p>Since the classroom was providing game sites and even a chat, I made my first real game website, codenamed "Gaming PC Games Best 2." Oliver never intended the classroom to be a game link hub—Hunter had pressured him into it. Anyway, I added an embedded Minecraft game, and Oliver added the rest of the games. Eventually, "Gaming PC Games Best 2" evolved into what is now known as <strong>Unblocked Premium</strong>.</p>

<p>When we ran out of INTERSTELLAR links, I went home and searched for it on Google. I found a GitHub repository with directions and hosted it on Vercel, a web hosting service. I shared it with the classroom, and people used it a lot. In fact, in just 30 days, they used a significant amount of data according to Vercel. Time passed, and I wondered, "How is mine not blocked?" I thought maybe the school was planning something.</p>

<p>And I think they did. Eventually, it finally got blocked. After that, I made a new link, but I was feeling guilty, so I scheduled a shutdown date for my <strong>Google Site</strong>. However, I didn’t set a shutdown date for INTERSTELLAR. I announced on Google Sites that I would be shutting down the websites.</p>

<p>Before I could shut it down, I got called to the office. I was scared, and a kid said, "Oh, you got in trouble." When I went to the office, they told me to stop creating websites that bypass the school filters. After talking to the admin, I went home and shut down every site I had hosted, including INTERSTELLAR.</p>

<p>After getting caught, they deleted my projects, including the fake site, but I had a backup of one of the game websites. After all that, I stopped creating websites that the school blocks.</p>
